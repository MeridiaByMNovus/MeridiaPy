npm run start:server # run the in the examples/ folder and not in browser/ or electron/
```

```

- Uses vite to bundle the app and serve it in the browser.

### Electron

## Running Examples Using Workspaces

From the `examples` root folder, run these scripts to start the different examples:

```bash
npm install
npm run start:example:browser   # runs browser workspace example
npm run start:example:electron  # runs electron workspace example
npm run start:server            # runs server workspace example
```

## Notes

- Make sure you have Node.js and npm/yarn installed.
- All examples are tested with Vite 7.x and Electron.
- Ports and workspace URLs can be customized in the example source code.
- The server workspace should be started before clients that connect to it.
